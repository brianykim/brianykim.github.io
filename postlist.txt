Move from Trello into here:

Why you went into tech

Why you do hackathons and organize them

Our lives... appreciating the small things

Current landscape of tech

The importance of empathy

Building with reckless abandon to discover your purpose

My Dream Date
  - Beach + Ice Skating + Dancing with slow dancing at end + maybe curl up to a movie

Do I know what I'm doing? Not really...
