CRAFT THIS DANG TALK BRIAN

THE TALK
UNLOCKING THE FULL POTENTIAL OF OUR HUMANITY

our scientific paradigm
to apply to humanity
gain maturity, empathy

why do we reflect... it's because we seek
a more universal truth
in a way that encompasses more diverse perspectives
more possibilities
and in some mystical way at the same time
is more in tune with our personal convictions

why am I an atheist? because i'm a humanist
but that's not really the point
it's because i take logic to the max

in accepting people will live after us and when we die, we die
we can come up with a beautiful ideal


IT'S CURIOSITY...
THAT'S WHAT KEEPS US PUSHING THE ROCK

IN THE HOPE OF ALL THESE HOPELESS BATTLES

WHY IT IS
THAT WE HAVE TO CONTINUOUSLY STRUGGLE
AT LEAST WE'RE STRUGGLING AGAINST
NEW THINGS... NEW FRONTIERS?
THE MOST POWERFUL BASIC CORE OF HUMANITY...
IS NOT HUMANITY
AND NOT JUST THE PRESERVATION AND CHAMPIONING OF SENTIENT LIFE...

BUT CURIOSITY AND THE EXPANSION OF KNOWLEDGE
