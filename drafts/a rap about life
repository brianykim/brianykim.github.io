make a beat and your own song to it

write about the key to the human condition
  why do we continue to push up new rocks
  we need bad to become good
  we live through contrast
  so what's the point of fighting these battles
  if we're always just going to lose to something else
  and it comes down to something as basic
  as curiosity
  we want to know the true what if
  the truth the knowledge we want to expand it
  that's what science is to me
  that's what having the balls to talk to that girl you like is
  it's you figuring out WHAT IF
  and you even want to think about what if what ifs
  WHAT IF WE SURVIVED OURSELVES RUINING HTE HPLANET
  WHAT KIINDS OOF PROBLEMS WILL WE FACE IN A MULTIPLANETARY SYSTEM
  WE EVEN WANT THE CHANCE TO DREAM
  and of course we don't dream like that...
  but problems are inherent in new things
  but we dont think about hte problems, we think about hte dreams
  it's that new thing that keeps us going
  we want to struggle against new things
  push boundaries, be on frontiers
  whether it be withiin our own walls
  or the walls of humanity
  the walls of sentient life
  the walls of
  there are so many things we have to balance
  and we'll definitely continue trying to balance these things
  but it's curiosity that keeps us moving forward regardless
