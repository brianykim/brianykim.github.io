if it was just for money, I would never have done it

the small things we do or we decide that form who we are

taking this job that wasn't a real job changed me
turned me into a health freak that positively impacted those around me

we need to appreciate that though our aspirations may not
be that large, we need to be able to appreciate that our lives
are our lives and we take the positive from that whenever we can





at the same time the world is so large filled with different people

but empathy makes us so much better
don't make judgments based on one thing
