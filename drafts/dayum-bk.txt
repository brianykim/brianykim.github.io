vibing with the beat such a treat take seat
feeling myself cuz i'm so conceited
mf doom beat feels the room
take you high like y'all on shroom
it's a battle show down, tellin me to slow down
hit on your girl, they be yelling out ho down


liam duff *pause* little kid man scruff
rockin shaved head still aint so tough
shaking brothers everywhere just like my name is juju
when girls get a look, they only confuse you
is that that dude from home alone 2
why am I bagging, when we're in teh same crew
my bars are on another level like you're in the basement
you want hard, I'll slam your face into the pavement

you get high, I stay down, keep it with the real sound
here in la bk, runs the rown
you fold in half when push comes to shove
jk, my man, you know it's all the same love


my girls stay fly just like a flock of birds
while you hang with cows like the good shepherd
best come swinging like you're ready to fight
cuz my rhymes will turn darkness 2 light

your life's a drought of that I'm aware
while I make it rain even when the sky's fair
pass legislation to please stop the violence
when a brooklyn boy takes on west coast's finest

when it comes to flows you know I'm the master
should make you a dashboard to prep for this disaster
put you in plaster, like I'm a spell caster
you think you think quick, but my wit is faster
