Toolmaking seems to be the big one just because in how it directly addresses your main question: Augmenting ourselves to do things we can't do on our own.

With regards to your side discussion regarding sacrifice and progress, it seems interesting that as we advance and get rid of problems we see fit to eradicate and evolve to adapt to new situations, we only fill the void of worries with new worries. We don't have to hunt/gather to survive all the time anymore so now people consider questions like: "What should I do with my life?" or "How can we stop people from dying?" which would beget even more problems and people trying to strive for solutions and I find it's because we as human beings measure life in contrasts. We only truly feel highs because we've experienced lows and we strive as we may so people don't have to deal with particular problems, new ones will inevitably arise. This by no means is saying that people shouldn't pursue ridding the world of problems, but moreso along Chén﻿'s point, it's about expanding human knowledge/experience at the end of the day. Kind of like a curiosity of, huh: what if we solved this problem? or what would life be like? and actually working towards seeing a solution or just new/unexpected outcome through.

Huh, in that case I guess curiosity strong enough to drive us to change things is something I see humans have that other species don't, but at the same time maybe civilization could be "bettered" or at least advanced if more humans actually embraced it?

Might've strayed, but hopefully not too much in terms of content, but it's something I've wanted to write an essay on for a while haha
