at times we get this glimpse, a vision, of a beautiful life we could have
a life that doesn't consider all the things you do right now
one that just IS. and ISes beautifully.

what we do specifically to get there is a mystery

but once we do, once we get the moment
where our current lives seem to resonate so perfectly with our visions
so harmoniously, just as the perfect stroke of a violinist's bow
through a resonant concert hall, that we say
this is what i live for.

other times, our minds get so bogged down with thoughts
we can feel our feet become so heavy that we slowly cover
less and less distance with every step, until we're barely
dragging ourselves across...


life's give and take of these moments helps us appreciate them
