Bush Talk Blog Post
And was waiting for a comment like this, *disclaimer I personally identify more as a Democrat* but during the talk you were given a more in depth look into the thinking behind the decisions he made which were mostly based off the values he clearly laid out from the start, universal freedoms for all humans (which is why he advocated for democracy in other parts of the world, when people are given a voice, he feels that they're less likely to resort to extremism which was what 9/11 was a reminder of, that the human condition of other countries is also a matter of national security, the ideal his actions were based on I'd say are pretty understandable to accept) he's an intellectual and very personable man
