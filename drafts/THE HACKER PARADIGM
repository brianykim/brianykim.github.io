THE HACKER PARADIGM

about building ideas that will legitimately help people...

we're all to set on jobs

and the pigeonhole principle makes us all competitors rather than collaborators

especially students, we have time and should be cool
building things, whose sole purpose
is to help people or to build something just awesome

and all these new people coming onto the scene
what example are we setting for them?
they get infatuated with the same technology that we do
and the same potential for impact that we do
but the overemphasis that we place on the not so important things
the shallow facades of big bucks and reputation...
we fail to revisit and reinforce the true
hacker
paradigm

WHAT HAVE YOU BUILT AND WHY'D YOU DO IT?

oh you're using this technology? I heard that's dumb.
OH WE SHOULD USE THIS API, why? just because...
I went to a hackathon... I'm a hacker...
