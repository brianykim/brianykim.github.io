<p>This is something I've been meaning to do for a while as an outlet for a lot of ideas I have. This is simply a way of putting into writing what goes on in my head, and whether that helps clear my head or entertains (and hopefully even enlightens) others, may this blog find purpose. Needless to say, as this is being written this site is largely under construction, but there's definitely more to come. </p>
